                    Welcome to Infinitus Therapeia, LLC, a sanctuary of meaningful touch, deep relaxation, and long-term healing—now offered exclusively in the comfort of your home. With over 25 years of experience as a licensed myomassologist, massage therapist, massage educator, and skin care professional, I bring a full spectrum of therapeutic techniques to your space, allowing you to unwind without ever needing to travel.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The name Infinitus Therapeia blends Latin and Greek, much like the anatomical language used to describe the incredible body you live in. It reflects my extensive professional background and the belief that there are truly endless therapeutic possibilities when we honor each person as unique.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I proudly provide in-home services only, and I am willing to travel within an hour of Utica, Michigan.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Whether you’re seeking gentle, restorative energetic therapies or focused deep tissue work for chronic pain and scar tissue, each session is tailored to meet your needs with warmth, skill, and intention. This is a space to exhale, reconnect, and feel deeply cared for—right where you feel safest.
